# How to generate documentation

The documentation is automatically generated by GitHub workflows when committing to the *master* branch and deployed on
*gh-pages* branch. When the repo is turned public, it will be published automatically. 

Alternatively the documentation can be generated locally, first go into the documentation folder:

``cd doc``

Then run:

``make html`` (linux) or ``make.bat html`` (windows)
