# pipapr

Welcome to APR-pipelines (`pipapr`), a package based on Adaptive Particle Representation (APR) to accelerate
image processing and research imvolving imaging and microscopy.

pipapr was built on:

- [LibAPR](https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/LibAPR): the C++ backbone library
- [pyapr](https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/pyapr/): a python wrapper for LibAPR including unique features

For more information on usage, examples and notebooks, check our documentation.

Briefly, `pipapr` allows to accelerate image processing for 3D data-sets while lowering the hardware requirements. It
is made of several independant modules that are tailored to convert, stitch, segment, map to an atlas and visualize
data. `pipapr` can work as a postprocessing tool and is also compatible with real time usage during acquisitions, 
enabling minimal lead time between imaging and analysis.

# How to install

- Download from the repo
- `cd` into the folder
- run `pip install -e .`

# How to build documentation

The documentation is automatically generated by GitHub workflows when committing to the *master* branch and deployed on
*gh-pages* branch. When the repo is turned public, it will be published automatically. 

Alternatively the documentation can be generated locally, first `cd` into the documentation folder:

`cd doc`

Then run:

`make html` (linux) or `make.bat html` (windows)
